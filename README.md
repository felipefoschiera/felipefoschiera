### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the Universidade de Passo Fundo, Brazil, currently on my last year.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Machine Learning, with a focus on Natural Language Processing.
- :closed_book: I have some research experience working with genetic algorithms for optimization problems, specially focused on the curriculum-based course timetabling problem
- :computer: I also have some experience with competitive programming, having participated in multiple local and national ICPC competitions. I also organized classes and trainings for high school and university undergraduate students to the Brazilian Olympiads in Informatics and the International Collegiate Programming Contest, covering advanced programming topics related to algorithms, data structures, graph theory, dynamic programming, among other topics
